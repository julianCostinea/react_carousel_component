# react_carousel_component
Simple carousel made for react. To be reused


### Limitations
Currently hard coded for only 3 slides, but more can be added manually in the HTML. Refractoring with a forEach loop should be done as the next step.

### Example
```
<Carousel 
    slide1 = 'Text for slide 1'
    slide2 = 'Text for slide 2'
    slide3 = 'Text for slide 3'
/>
```
